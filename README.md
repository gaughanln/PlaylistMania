# PlaylistMania 🎧

## Description

Tired of listening to the same chart toppers that play on repeat? Looking for new music? Welcome to Playlist Mania. Here you will be able to search for an artist and explore new songs to add to your favorites and generate your own playlist. The search results will give you samples to listen to so you can decide if you like it before you download it. (Cloud storage is precious these days!) You'll need to login and create an account as well - Music isn't free! 😉 


## 🕺🏽 User Story 💃🏼
